# admin-dashboard
An Admin Dashboard, showing new grid + flexbox knowledge (Not Functional, only the project's part work)

You can see the live test at: [Admin Dashboard: Live Page](https://joaquinarruiz.github.io/admin-dashboard/)

#### Process and Some Thoughts:
I drawed everything in paper just to know where I was going to use grids, for the more "simple" things I used flexbox. 
The project took me around 5 to 6 hours, most of it was the CSS of course. I like the design, need some improvements anyway

As always you can check the project at the footer.

Nice project.

#### Known Issues:   
- Not responsive.
- Maybe change the color palette used?
